      <h3>Account Security</h3>
      <p>Your accounts are the keys to your digital kingdom. Protecting them is the single most important step you can take.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Use a Password Manager:</strong> Humans are bad at creating and remembering strong, unique passwords for every site. A password manager solves this by generating and storing them for you. This is the #1 defense against credential stuffing.</li>
        <li><strong>Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> MFA adds a crucial second layer of security. Even if an attacker steals your password, they can't log in without your second factor (e.g., a code from your phone app, a text message, or a physical security key).</li>
        <li><strong>Review Recovery Options:</strong> Ensure your account recovery email and phone number are up-to-date and secure. If an attacker compromises your email, they can use it to reset passwords for your other accounts.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Device & Network Security</h3>
      <p>The devices you use and the networks you connect to are potential entry points for attackers.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Keep Software Updated:</strong> This is non-negotiable. Software updates contain critical security patches that fix vulnerabilities discovered by researchers. Running outdated software is like leaving your front door unlocked. Enable automatic updates whenever possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Reputable Endpoint Protection:</strong> Modern antivirus/anti-malware software does more than just scan for viruses. It provides real-time protection against ransomware, malicious websites, and other threats.</li>
        <li><strong>Be Wary of Public Wi-Fi:</strong> Unsecured public Wi-Fi networks are a hunting ground for attackers who can perform Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. Avoid logging into sensitive accounts (banking, email) on public Wi-Fi. If you must, use a trusted VPN.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Data Hygiene & Awareness</h3>
      <p>Treat your personal data like cash. Be mindful of where it is, who has it, and how it's protected.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Back Up Your Data:</strong> Ransomware can destroy your files in an instant. Regular backups are your safety net. Follow the 3-2-1 rule: <strong>3</strong> copies of your data, on <strong>2</strong> different media types, with <strong>1</strong> copy off-site (e.g., in the cloud or a physical drive at another location).</li>
        <li><strong>Use Encryption:</strong> Encrypt the hard drive on your computer (e.g., BitLocker for Windows, FileVault for macOS) and your smartphone. This ensures that if your device is stolen, the data on it is unreadable.</li>
        <li><strong>Minimize Your Data Footprint:</strong> Before you give an app a permission or sign up for a new service, ask yourself if it's necessary. The less data you share, the less there is to be exposed in a data breach.</li>
        <li><strong>Recognize Phishing:</strong> Learn to spot the signs of a phishing attempt: a sense of urgency, poor grammar, suspicious links (hover before you click!), and requests for personal information. When in doubt, don't click.</li>
      </ul>

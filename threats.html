    <div class="card">
      <h3>Phishing</h3>
      <p>Phishing attacks use deceptive emails, messages, or websites to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, or personal data. They often create a sense of urgency or fear.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Spear Phishing:</strong> A targeted attack on a specific person or organization.</li>
        <li><strong>Whaling:</strong> Spear phishing aimed at high-profile executives.</li>
        <li><strong>Smishing/Vishing:</strong> Phishing conducted via SMS text messages or voice calls.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Malware (Malicious Software)</h3>
      <p>Malware is any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server, client, or computer network. It's a broad category that includes many different types of threats.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ransomware:</strong> Encrypts a victim's files and demands a ransom payment for the decryption key.</li>
        <li><strong>Trojans:</strong> Disguise themselves as legitimate software to trick users into installing them, creating a backdoor for attackers.</li>
        <li><strong>Spyware:</strong> Secretly gathers information about a person or organization and sends it to another entity.</li>
        <li><strong>Adware:</strong> Automatically delivers advertisements, often in a manner that is unexpected and intrusive.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Account Takeover (ATO)</h3>
      <p>This occurs when an attacker gains unauthorized access to a user's account. This is often achieved through automated attacks that exploit poor password hygiene.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Credential Stuffing:</strong> Using lists of leaked usernames and passwords from one data breach to try and log in to other services.</li>
        <li><strong>Password Spraying:</strong> Trying a single, common password (like "Password123!") against many different accounts.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Software Vulnerabilities</h3>
      <p>Flaws, bugs, or weaknesses in software code or system configurations that can be exploited by an attacker to perform unauthorized actions.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Unpatched Systems:</strong> Failing to apply security patches leaves systems open to known, publicly documented vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Zero-Day Exploit:</strong> An attack that targets a previously unknown vulnerability, meaning there is no patch available for it yet.</li>
        <li><strong>Misconfigurations:</strong> Incorrectly configured security settings, such as leaving a database open to the internet without a password.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack</h3>
      <p>An attacker secretly intercepts and relays communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other. This allows the attacker to eavesdrop on or alter the conversation. This is a major risk on unsecured public Wi-Fi networks.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Supply-Chain Attack</h3>
      <p>A sophisticated attack that targets a trusted third-party vendor or supplier who provides software or services. By compromising the vendor, the attacker gains access to all of that vendor's customers, often on a massive scale.</p>
